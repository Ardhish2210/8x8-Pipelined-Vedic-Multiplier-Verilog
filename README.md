# 8x8 Pipelined Vedic Multiplier on FPGA Using SQRT Carry Select Adder with Common Boolean Logic (CBL)

This repository contains the Verilog implementation of an 8x8 pipelined Vedic multiplier, optimized using a modular approach with Square Root Carry Select Adder (SQRT CSLA) based on Common Boolean Logic (CBL). The design is deployed on the Basys 3 FPGA board (Artix-7) and tested using Xilinx Vivado.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the implementation of an 8x8 pipelined Vedic multiplier with the following key aspects:

- **Vedic Multiplier (Urdhva Tiryagbhyam Sutra)**: Efficient partial product generation using vertical and crosswise multiplication.
- **Pipelined Architecture**: Multiplier stages partitioned into pipeline stages using register boundaries for continuous data flow.
- **SQRT Carry Select Adder using Common Boolean Logic (CBL)**: Modular 8-bit adder structure using 2-bit and 3-bit blocks to reduce redundancy and improve speed.

## Advantages:
- **Reduced Area**: Eliminates redundant sum and carry circuits.
- **Improved Speed**: Avoids MUX-based selection logic, minimizing logic depth.
- **Power Efficiency**: Lower dynamic power consumption through reduced logic switching.
- **Scalability**: Optimizes delay and area trade-offs for larger bit-widths.
